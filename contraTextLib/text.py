# doc text needed for transformers model

BERT_START_DOCSTRING = r"""
    This model inherits from :class:`~transformers.PreTrainedModel`. Check the superclass documentation for the generic
    methods the library implements for all its model (such as downloading or saving, resizing the input embeddings,
    pruning heads etc.)
    This model is also a PyTorch `torch.nn.Module <https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/nn.html#torch.nn.Module>`__
    subclass. Use it as a regular PyTorch Module and refer to the PyTorch documentation for all matter related to
    general usage and behavior.
    Parameters:
        config (:class:`~transformers.BertConfig`): Model configuration class with all the parameters of the model.
            Initializing with a config file does not load the weights associated with the model, only the
            configuration. Check out the :meth:`~transformers.PreTrainedModel.from_pretrained` method to load the model
            weights.
"""

BERT_INPUTS_DOCSTRING = r"""
    Args:
        input_ids (:obj:`torch.LongTensor` of shape :obj:`({0})`):
            Indices of input sequence tokens in the vocabulary.
            Indices can be obtained using :class:`~transformers.BertTokenizer`. See
            :meth:`transformers.PreTrainedTokenizer.encode` and :meth:`transformers.PreTrainedTokenizer.__call__` for
            details.
            `What are input IDs? <../glossary.html#input-ids>`__
        attention_mask (:obj:`torch.FloatTensor` of shape :obj:`({0})`, `optional`):
            Mask to avoid performing attention on padding token indices. Mask values selected in ``[0, 1]``:
            - 1 for tokens that are **not masked**,
            - 0 for tokens that are **masked**.
            `What are attention masks? <../glossary.html#attention-mask>`__
        token_type_ids (:obj:`torch.LongTensor` of shape :obj:`({0})`, `optional`):
            Segment token indices to indicate first and second portions of the inputs. Indices are selected in ``[0,
            1]``:
            - 0 corresponds to a `sentence A` token,
            - 1 corresponds to a `sentence B` token.
            `What are token type IDs? <../glossary.html#token-type-ids>`_
        position_ids (:obj:`torch.LongTensor` of shape :obj:`({0})`, `optional`):
            Indices of positions of each input sequence tokens in the position embeddings. Selected in the range ``[0,
            config.max_position_embeddings - 1]``.
            `What are position IDs? <../glossary.html#position-ids>`_
        head_mask (:obj:`torch.FloatTensor` of shape :obj:`(num_heads,)` or :obj:`(num_layers, num_heads)`, `optional`):
            Mask to nullify selected heads of the self-attention modules. Mask values selected in ``[0, 1]``:
            - 1 indicates the head is **not masked**,
            - 0 indicates the head is **masked**.
        inputs_embeds (:obj:`torch.FloatTensor` of shape :obj:`({0}, hidden_size)`, `optional`):
            Optionally, instead of passing :obj:`input_ids` you can choose to directly pass an embedded representation.
            This is useful if you want more control over how to convert :obj:`input_ids` indices into associated
            vectors than the model's internal embedding lookup matrix.
        output_attentions (:obj:`bool`, `optional`):
            Whether or not to return the attentions tensors of all attention layers. See ``attentions`` under returned
            tensors for more detail.
        output_hidden_states (:obj:`bool`, `optional`):
            Whether or not to return the hidden states of all layers. See ``hidden_states`` under returned tensors for
            more detail.
        return_dict (:obj:`bool`, `optional`):
            Whether or not to return a :class:`~transformers.file_utils.ModelOutput` instead of a plain tuple.
